           Express.js, React.js, and Node.js converge to streamline task management. Leveraging MongoDB 
           for data storage and Express.js for seamless server-side operations, the application effortlessly
           handles CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, enabling users to add, edit, mark complete,
           and delete tasks with ease. The front-end, built with React.js, delivers a fluid and intuitive user 
           interface, allowing for dynamic task organization and real-time updates. With its responsive design 
           and robust functionality, this project showcases the fusion of modern technologies to create a user-centric
           and efficient task management solution.

               the front-end delivers an immersive and intuitive interface for patrons to explore and place orders seamlessly.
               On the back-end, Node.js, alongside MongoDB and Express.js, follows the MVC design pattern to ensure efficient
               data management and server-side logic. With Joi validation, data integrity is upheld, guaranteeing reliable
               transactions. This project harmonizes modern technologies to create a dynamic platform that redefines the restaurant ordering experience, from browsing menus to placing orders, with sophistication and ease.
